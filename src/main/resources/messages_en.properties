# Massenzio Case Study Page
cases.massenzio.hero.title=Mapping Basilica di Massenzio
cases.massenzio.subtitle=SANTA CECILIA RESOUNDS IN MASSENZIO AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE BASILICA
cases.massenzio.description.p1=We were delighted to have animated this wonderful event with our video mapping. The Accademia Barocca of Santa Cecilia performed Vivaldi's Four Seasons with soloist and conductor Andrea Zanon and Toni Servillo as narrator. During the performance, OSC Innovation realised the architectural video mapping of the vault and the back, taking care of the 3D, multimedia content and hardware technology, and decorated the beautiful Basilica of Massenzio with an animated colour commentary, which accompanied the musical theme for its entire duration.
cases.massenzio.description.p2=The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia is back, after 46 years, on Sunday 8 June at 9pm in the Basilica of Massenzio, on the occasion of its reopening to the public after five years of restoration and redevelopment work overseen by the Colosseum Archaeological Park, to return the prestigious musical stage to the world.
cases.massenzio.description.p3="This is an evening of joy and great satisfaction for all of us: we reopen the Basilica of Massenzio to the public after five years of restoration. One of the objectives was to offer a new narrative of the Basilica, with a tour route and a stage that could once again host the summer concerts of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, bringing the institution back inside the monument,' says Alfonsina Russo, Director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park.
